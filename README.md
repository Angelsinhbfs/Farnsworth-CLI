# Farnsworth-CLI
Farnsworth cli is a helper app to upload media files to your farnsworth instance. I suggest building it and placing it somewhere like home/[usr]/bin and then adding it to your path. It works best if you can call it from the folder you want to upload. It relies on ffmpeg being installed and in your path. It will save the credentials and host you last used so that you dont have to type that in every time. enjoy :)
